== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How does the Figma to WordPress Convertor Plugin work?**

UiChemy works by integrating directly with Figma, Elementor, Bricks & Gutenberg(Coming Soon). Once you have designed your website layout in Figma, you can export a template JSON or push the file directly using our UiChemy WordPress plugin. It's a simple 3-step process; just follow our design guidelines in the docs. To get started, please check our documentation.

**Is this plugin a standalone software or specifically designed for WordPress?**

This is a Figma Plugin that you need to install in Figma. From there, you can export the design in a template JSON or install the UiChemy WordPress plugin to directly push the design from Figma to your WordPress site.

**Is coding knowledge required to operate the Figma to WordPress Convertor Plugin?**

Not at all. UiChemy does not require you to know any lines of code. It works seamlessly between both platforms; all you have to do is plug in and export your designs.

**Do you have plans to Plans to have Figma to Bricks Builder?**

Yes, we've released our Bricks Builder integration.

**Do you have plans to have Figma to WordPress (Gutenberg Block Editor)?**

Yes, we've already started working on a Gutenberg version. This will allow you to convert Figma designs to the default WordPress Block editor, aka Gutenberg.

**Do I need to pay to use UiChemy?**

We have a FREE plan that allows up to 10 design exports per month. To export more, we suggest checking out our paid plans.

**How can I access support for more than 10 users?**

To accommodate more users with our paid plan, we suggest stacking the deal. For instance, buy 2 LTDs to get 20 users.

**Which versions of Elementor does the plugin support?**

We support the latest version of Elementor. We closely follow Elementor updates and make changes for the best compatibility.

**Is Elementor PRO necessary for the plugin's functionality?**

You can use UiChemy with both Elementor FREE and Elementor PRO. It depends on your design; if your design needs Elementor PRO widgets like a contact form, having the Pro version helps in creating better designs. We support both Elementor FREE & Pro widgets.

**Does it operate solely with Elementor or require additional Elementor addons?**

As makers of the popular Elementor Addons with over 100K+ active users, we aim to make life easier for our users. Hence, we've added support for The Plus Addons for Elementor widgets. These widgets allow you to go beyond and create beautiful websites, offering over 120+ unique Elementor widgets with powerful design controls.

**How accurate are the design conversions from Figma to WordPress using this plugin?**

The accuracy depends entirely on your design structure. We support Absolute position but we recommend you to use Auto Layout one for better responsive design. However, if your design follows our simple standard design guidelines, we've observed up to 90% - 95% accuracy in design conversion from Figma to Elementor. With every update, we aim to increase this percentage.

**Is there a refund policy if I'm dissatisfied with the plugin's performance?**

We want to ensure you love our products. That's why we offer our highest 60-day money-back guarantee for our LTDs. If you're not satisfied with our results, you can always request a refund, and our team will facilitate a 100% refund.

All UiChemy users receive support directly from our help desk. You can raise a ticket from store.posimyth.com/helpdesk, and our team will get back to you promptly.

**Are the designs generated by the plugin responsive by default?**

That depends as if you are using Auto Layout, Most structures will be responsive by it's own. On top of that We've provided responsive manager settings in UiChemy, Where you can customise it as per your design structure and set multiple responsive values, That is super useful for websites which made with Branding guidelines. You can set the value to ensure the best responsive conversion. Please check this to understand more about the responsive manager.
