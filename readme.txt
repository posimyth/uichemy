== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How does the Figma to WordPress Convertor Plugin work?**

UiChemy works by integrating directly with Figma, Elementor, Bricks & Gutenberg(Coming Soon). Once you have designed your website layout in Figma, you can export a template JSON or push the file directly using our UiChemy WordPress plugin. It's a simple 3-step process; just follow our design guidelines in the docs. To get started, please check our documentation.

**Is this plugin a standalone software or specifically designed for WordPress?**

This is a WordPress Plugin that you need to install to directly import your Figma designs from UiChemy Figma Plugin. This plugin acts as connector to fetch templates from Figma.com

**Is coding knowledge required to operate the Figma to WordPress Convertor Plugin?**

Not at all. UiChemy does not require you to know any lines of code. It works seamlessly between both platforms; all you have to do is plug in and export your designs.

**Do you plan to add Figma to Bricks Builder Convertor?**

Yes, we've released our Bricks Builder integration - [Figma Plugin for Bricks Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1344313361212431142) 

**Do you plan to add Figma to WordPress (Gutenberg Block Editor)?**

Yes, we have released a version compatible with the Gutenberg Block Editor. This allows you to convert Figma designs to the default WordPress Block editor, aka Gutenberg Editor. Additionally, For Tagging - our plugin supports blocks from [The Plus Blocks for Gutenberg](https://theplusblocks.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=readmepage&utm_campaign=links).

**Do I need to pay to use UiChemy?**

We have a FREE plan that allows up to 10 design exports per month. To export more, we suggest checking out our paid plans.


**Which versions of Elementor does the plugin support?**

We support the latest version of Elementor. We closely follow Elementor updates and make changes for the best compatibility.

**Is Elementor PRO necessary for the plugin's functionality?**

You can use UiChemy with both Elementor FREE and Elementor PRO. It depends on your design; if your design needs Elementor PRO widgets like a contact form, having the Pro version helps in creating better designs. We support both Elementor FREE & Pro widgets.

**Does it operate solely with Elementor or require additional Elementor addons?**

As makers of the popular Elementor Addon with over 120K+ active users, we aim to make life easier for our users. Hence, we've added support for The Plus Addons for Elementor widgets. These widgets allow you to go beyond and create beautiful websites, offering over 120+ unique Elementor widgets with powerful design controls.

**How accurate are the design conversions from Figma to WordPress using this plugin?**

The accuracy depends entirely on your design structure. We support Absolute position, but we recommend you to use Auto Layout one for better responsive design. However, if your design follows our simple standard design guidelines, we've observed up to 90% - 95% accuracy in design conversion from Figma to Elementor. With every update, we aim to increase this percentage.

**Is there a refund policy if I'm dissatisfied with the plugin's performance?**

We want to ensure you love our products. That's why we offer our highest 60-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our results, you can always request a refund, and our team will facilitate a 100% refund.

That depends on, as if you are using Auto Layout, most structures will be responsive by its own. On top of that We've provided responsive manager settings in UiChemy, Where you can customize it as per your design structure and set multiple responsive values, that is super useful for websites which made with Branding guidelines. You can set the value to ensure the best responsive conversion. Please check this to understand more about the responsive manager.
